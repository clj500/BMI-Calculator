This repository contains all planning, development, and testing details for a Body Mass Index calculator application and web interface. The resulting python application prompts users to enter their height and weight in inches and pounds, and then calculates and returns the userâ€™s Body Mass Index number based on those measurements. After completion of the initial application, a web interface was developed through Django. The project documents the continuous integration and unit testing of the application and its corresponding web interface.
